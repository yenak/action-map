Feature: Make phone call

  Users should be able to make phone calls to representatives. This is
  an essential part to the project as it helps convey the user's interests
  the best.

  Background:
    Given John Doe has the phone number 111-111-1111
    And the following users exist:
    | email         | password | interests |
    | user1@test    | password | []        |

  # Scenario: calling a representative when logged in
  #   Given I am logged in with email, "user1@test", and password, "password"
  #   And I am on John Doe's page
  #   When I press "Call"
  #   Then I should place a call to 111-111-1111

  # Scenario: trying to call a representative when not logged in should not work
  #   Given I am not logged in
  #   And I am on John Doe's page
  #   When I press "Call"
  #   Then I should not place a call
  #   And I should be on the login page
  #   And I should see "You must be logged in to call."
