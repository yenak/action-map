# Brief Overview
ActionMap seeks to provide an integrated, seamless, and shareable platform that makes it easier for voters to connect with the progressive community while at the same time enabling progressive organizations, candidates, and elected leaders to reach new activists. The idea behind the application is to allow the user to visualize the political environment within all levels of government while also providing a platform to contact and voice their opinions to the decision makers within politics.
